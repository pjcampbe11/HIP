Use https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/intro/#installation for the template Then use SafetyPrompts or some other dataset as the dource for Prompt flow

Then, if the HIP script works then use that for the final part of setup. 
I used AI to analyze the script so a descion can be made quickly reagding if it will be used or not
If not, just use a few common locations in the docs to get the injections in
I have another set of about 10-15 decent prompts to test
Lastly, prompts on a web server and maybe inject prompts into a HTML file and sens as attachmet

Use this tool to generate prompts

Prompt flow

Prompt flow is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

With prompt flow, you will be able to:

Create flows that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other tools together in a executable workflow.

Debug and iterate your flows, especially tracing interaction with LLMs with ease.

Evaluate your flows, calculate quality and performance metrics with larger datasets.

Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.

Deploy your flows to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your appâ€™s code base easily.

(Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of Prompt flow in Azure AI.
